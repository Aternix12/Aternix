        <p>If you’re not happy with the graphic design after the 3rd draft; you have the option to terminate the contract.
            In this circumstance, any fees paid to this point will be considered payment for services rendered, and, will
            not be refunded.
            <br><br>
            Any layout designs will be provided to you (the client) as temporary domain if requested

            contract. If the project proceeds past the 3rd design revision, you will be held fully responsible for the
            outright purchase price of the website remaining contract term.
        </p>
        <h3>Text Content</h3>
        <p>Whilst every attempt will be made to ensure concise and correct spelling and punctuation, Aternix will not be
            held responsible for the accuracy of any text input into the webpage. It is the responsibility of you (the
            client) to confirm spelling and punctuation and notify us if any portion is incorrect. If updates are supplied
            and require re-editing after changes have been made, we reserve the right to charge for these updates.

            cross-compatibility between web browsers and handheld devices (e.g. mobile phones, ipads, android tablets) this
            is carried out using emulation software and is a representation only. This by no means guarantees the
            output/layout will appear exactly as expected due to the differences in software and hardware. If you wish to
            have better cross compatibility with a specific device, a custom CSS design fee will apply. In some
            circumstances we may need to deviate from suggested web-design techniques to ensure display as per your
            requests.
            <br><br>

        <h3>Domain Name Registration</h3>
        <p>In the case of the purchase of a .com.au or .com domain, this will automatically be registered for a default of
            two years (non-negotiable). Aternix will renew the domain name automatically on your behalf and forward an
            invoice for payment. We accept no responsibility in respect of the use of a domain name by you. Both the
            registration of a domain name and its use are subject to the appropriate naming authority’s terms and
            conditions. You are responsible for awareness of and compliance with these terms. We do not warrant or guarantee
            that the domain name applied for will be registered in your name or is capable of being registered by you. You
            agree to waive any claims you may have against us in respect to any decision a naming authority may make and
            agree that any applicable fee paid by you is non-refundable if refused. Note: if you already have a domain name
            it is your responsibility to renew as required, alternatively you can request for us to manage renewal, however
            this will need to be churned(transferred) to our preferred provider at your cost.
        </p>
        <h3>Email</h3>
        <p>For those clients that we provide an e-mail service to, we will provide information on how to setup your email

        <p>All websites have the potential to be exposed to malicious activity such as hacking, or denial of service
            attacks. Irrelevant of the protections that you have in place, due to things such as malware, brute force
            attacks, or zero day exploits, we are unable to provide any guarantees that your website will be free of such
            hazards. We will not be held responsible for the security or maintenance of any of your data and suggest the
