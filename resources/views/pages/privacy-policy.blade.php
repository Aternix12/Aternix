        <h2 class="content-heading">Aternix's Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>It is Aternix’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our
            website. This privacy policy applies to www.aternix.com (hereinafter, “us”, “we”, “Aternix” or “aternix.com“).
            We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us
            through the website. We have adopted this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to explain what information may be
            collected on our website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the
            information to third parties. This privacy policy applies only to information we collect through the website and
            does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.
            <br><br>
            This privacy policy, together with the terms and conditions posted on our website, set forth the general rules
            and policies governing your use of our website. Depending on your activities when visiting our website, you may
            be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.
        </p>
        <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
        <p>Like most website operators, Aternix collects non-personally identifying information of the sort that web
            browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site,
            and the date and time of each visitor request. Aternix’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
            information is to better understand how no Aternix’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Aternix may
            release non-personally identifying information in the aggregate, for example, by publishing a report on trends
            in the usage of its website.
            <br><br>
            Aternix also collects potentially personally identifying information like internet protocol (IP) addresses.
            Aternix only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and
            discloses personally identifying information as described below.
        </p>
        <h3>Gathering of Personally Identifying Information</h3>
        <p>Certain visitors to Aternix websites choose to interact with Aternix in ways that require Aternix to gather
            personally identifying information. The amount and type of information that Aternix gathers depends on the
            nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at aternix.com to provide a
            username and email address.
        </p>
        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>The security of your personal information is important to us but remember that no method of transmission over the
            internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means
            to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
        </p>
        <h3>Advertisements</h3>
        <p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These
            cookies allow the ad server to recognise your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to
            compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among
            other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy
            policy covers the use of cookies by Aternix and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
        </p>
        <h3>Links to External Sites </h3>
        <p>Our service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link,
            you will be directed to that third party’s site. We strongly advise you to review the privacy policy and terms
            and conditions of every site you visit.
            <br><br>
            We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any
            third-party sites, products, or services.
        </p>
        <h3>Google Ads and Remarketing</h3>
        <p>Aternix uses the re-marketing services to advertise on third-party websites (including Google) to previous
            visitors to our site. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven’t completed a task on our
            site, for example using the contact form to make an enquiry. This could be in the form of an advertisement on
            the Google Search results page, or a site in the google display network. Third-party vendors, including google,
            use cookies to serve ads based on someone’s past visits. Of course, any data collected will be used in
            accordance with our own privacy policy and Google’s privacy policy.
            <br><br>
            You can set preferences for how google advertises to you using the google ad preferences page, and if you want
            to you can opt out of interest-based advertising entirely by cookie settings or permanently using a browser
            plugin.
